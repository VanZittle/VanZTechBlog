# VanZTechBlog

The world of technology thrives not only on innovation but also on the sharing of knowledge. This exchange of ideas is vital, as it fosters a community where concepts are clarified, advancements are discussed, and new technologies are explored. Every search for a technical topic reveals a wealth of articles, tutorials, and discussions authored by developers from all corners of the globe, demonstrating the value of writing as a means to both teach and learn in the ever-evolving tech landscape. This CMS-style blog site, developers can publish their blog posts so they are available to the public.  This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
